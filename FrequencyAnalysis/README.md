this is a frequency analysis project done using python
Frequency analysis
Frequency analysis works like the Ceaser Cipher only that 
in this case is that frequency analysis works with a shift cipher together 
with any substitution cipher where each letter always encrypts to just one
letter.
The frequency analysis process ocnsists of the following steps:
1. Creating a list of plaintext frequencies, sorted by frequencies
2.Creating a list of encrypted text frequencies, sorted by frequency
3.Merging these lists to create an estimated mapping between encrypted letters and plaintext lettersMerge these lists to create an estimated mapping between encrypted letters and plaintext letters
4.Using this mapping to create an approximate decryption of the encrypted text

In this case, we have created a file called FrequencyAnalysisAttack.py

NB: There is no guarantee the relative letter frequencies will remain in the same order
